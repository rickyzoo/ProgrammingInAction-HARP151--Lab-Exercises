    <h1>Economic Analysis of Food Price Inflation's Impact on Crime</h1>
    <img src="foodcrimelab2.jpeg" alt="Crime scene tape wrapped around a plate to represent the real relationship between food and crime">
    <p>This data analysis project was my final project for <b>ECON416 - Economic Analysis with Python</b> at SUNY Binghamton.</p>
    <p>In this project, I examine the relationship between food price inflation and the movement of crime in food secure and food insecure states. <br>
    I focus on food price inflation of different food baskets (Meat/Protein, Fruits & Vegetables, Dairy, etc) and crime data from 2 food secure and 2 food insecure states in order to examine potential relationships and correlations between the two issues.

    <h2>About the Data</h2> <!-- other element #2 -->
    <p>
    As mentioned earlier, I focus on crime rates in 2 food secure (<u>Virginia & North Dakota</u>) and 2 food insecure (<u>Mississippi & Alabama</u>) states. The crime data was taken directly from <a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/">Crime Data Explorer</a>, a government-operated website associated with the FBI. Crime data was broken down into violent and property crime rates per 100,000 people.<br>
    Provided below are direct links to the CSV files hosted on my Github repository containing data for each type of crime for each state:

            <li><a href="https://github.com/rickyzoo/Food_price_inflation_and_crime/blob/main/virg_all_prop_crime.csv">Property Crime in Virginia</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/rickyzoo/Food_price_inflation_and_crime/blob/main/virg_all_violent_crime.csv">Violent Crime in Virginia</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I was able to differentiate food secure vs. food insecure states by examining food insecurity data from <a href="https://www.socialpolicylab.org/post/grow-your-blog-community">SocialPolicyLab.org</a>, a data visualization research lab focused on economics and policy making content.</p>
    <p>Finally, I used CPI data from the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">FRED</a>, the ever-so-beloved website of Economists, to calculate food price inflation.</p>
